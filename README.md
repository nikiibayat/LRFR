# Low Resolution Face Recognition using SRGAN 
This repo uses a super resolution method (SRGAN) to identify very low resolution faces based on the experiment setup introduced in "On Low-Resolution Face Recognition in the Wild: Comparisons and New Techniques" paper.
This project is supposed to replicate "On Low-Resolution Face Recognition in the Wild: Comparisons and New Techniques" paper.
