# In this file a HR-LR pair will be returned from chosen dataset.

# HR size : 224x224 -bicubic interpolation
# LR size : a)21x15 b)16x12 c)11x8  -bicubic interpolation

# AR dataset: original LR and HR face images are taken from
# face images #01 and #14 respectively of each subject. Since
# the AR dataset has 100 subjects, we obtained 100 LRâ€“HR
# pairs of face images for this experiment.
